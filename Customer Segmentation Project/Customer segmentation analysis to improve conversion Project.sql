-- SUMMARY :- 

-- In simple words, this query:
   
-- Groups customers by when they joined and what type of account they have
-- Counts how many customers are in each group
-- Checks how many customers from each group are still active after 12 months
-- Calculates what percentage of customers are still active after 12 months
-- Shows this information for each month and account type, but only for groups that are at least 12 months old

-- This approach gives you a clear picture of customer retention for different types of accounts over time, focusing on long-term retention (12 months).


-- 10. Identify Common Account Combinations: Look at customers who have multiple account types and identify common combinations.

-- This step aggregates data for each customer:
-- 1. Creates an array of unique account types they have
-- 2. Counts the number of different account types
-- 3. Calculates average FICO score, total balance, and maximum tenure

	-- 2.3. Loan Product for long-term customers without one
